# Funnel Cake DAGs

This is the repository for Funnel Cake (PA Digital / DPLA Data QA Interface) Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs, e.g., data processing workflows) for data indexing to Solr + related jobs. These DAGs are expecting to be run within an Airflow installation akin to the one built by our [TUL Airflow Playbook (private repository)](https://github.com/tulibraries/ansible-playbook-airflow).

## Repository Structure

This repository has 3 main groups of files:
- Airflow DAG definition python files (ending with `_dag.py`);
- Airflow DAG tasks python files used by the above (starting with `task_`);
- and required local development, test, deployment, and CI files (`tests`, `configs`, `.travis`, Pipfile, etc.).

## Airflow Expectations

These the Airflow expectations for these Funnel Cake DAGs to successfully run:

**Libraries & Packages**

- Python 3.7
- Python Packages: see the [Pipfile](Pipfile)

**Airflow Variables**

- `FUNCAKE_CONFIGSET`: The SolrCloud Configset identifier to use for creating new Funnel Cake Collections & updating Aliases. Based on the https://github.com/tulibraries/funcake-solr latest release
- `FUNCAKE_OAI_ENDPT`: The OAI Endpoint to be harvested for indexing.
- `FUNCAKE_OAI_SET`: The OAI set used for harvesting from the OAI Endpoint (above). If all sets wanted, set to "" (but you have to set).
- `FUNCAKE_MD_PREFIX`: The OAI metadata prefix used for harvesting from the OAI Endpoint (above). This is required, per OAI-PMH specifications.
- `AIRFLOW_DATA_BUCKET`: The AWS S3 Bucket label (label / name, not ARN or URI) the harvested OAI-PMH XML data is put into / indexed from.
- `AIRFLOW_HOME`: The Airflow system home directory path. Used here for locating our `scripts` repository when running the indexing bash script.

**Airflow Connections**
- `SOLRCLOUD`: An HTTP Connection used to connect to SolrCloud.
- `AIRFLOW_S3`: An AWS (not S3 with latest Airflow upgrade) Connection used to manage AWS credentials (which we use to interact with our Airflow Data S3 Bucket).

**Infrastructure & Integration**

- Accessible DPLAH OAI-PMH API Endpoint (or whatever endpoint you're indexing from, as set by the Airflow Variable `FUNCAKE_OAI_ENDPT`)
- Accessible SolrCloud Endpoint, with created ConfigSet for the referenced `FUNCAKE_CONFIGSET`. The SolrCloud Collection is created and the SolrCloud Alias is created/updated based upon this Configset by this DAG.

## Local Development

### Run with Airflow Playbook Make Commands

Basically, clone https://github.com/tulibraries/ansible_playbook_airflow locally; in a shell at the top level of that repository, run `make up` then `make update`; then git clone/pull your working funcake_dags code to ansible_playbook_airflow/dags/funcake-dags. This shows & runs your development DAG code in the Airflow docker containers, with a webserver at http://localhost:8080.

The steps for this, typed out:

```
$ cd ~/path/to/cloned/ansible-playbook-airflow
$ pipenv shell
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ make up
# update `data/example-variables.json` to add whatever Airflow variables you want; you can also do this in the GUI if preferred.
# update `Makefile` to add whatever Airflow variables you want; you can also do this in the GUI if preferred.
# check http://localhost:8010 is running okay
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ make update
```

Then change into `dags/funcake_dags` and `git pull origin your-working-branch` to get your working branch locally available. *Symlinks will not work due to how Airflow & Docker handle mounts.* You could manually copy over files if that works better for you.

Continuing from above:

```
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ cd dags
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ git clone https://github.com/tulibraries/funcake_dags.git
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ cd funcake_dags
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ git checkout -b my-working-branch
```

Changes to this DAGs folder will be reflected in the local Airflow web UI and related Airflow services within a few seconds. *DAG folders in the ansible-playbook-airflow directory will not be replaced, updated, or touched by any make commands if they already exist.*

When you're done with local development, git commit & push your changes to funcake_dags up to your working branch, and tear down the docker resources:

```
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ make down
(ansible-playbook-airflow) $ exit # leaves the pipenv virtual environment
```

## Linting & Testing

How to run the `pylint` linter on this repository:

```
# Ensure you have the correct Python & Pip running:
$ python --version
  Python 3.7.2
$ pip --version
  pip 18.1 from /home/tul08567/.pyenv/versions/3.7.2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
# Install Pipenv:
$ pip install pipenv
  Collecting pipenv ...
# Install requirements in Pipenv; requires envvar:
$ SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes pipenv install --dev
  Pipfile.lock not found, creating ...
# Run the linter:
$ pipenv run pylint funcake_dags
  ...
```

Linting for Errors only (`pipenv run pylint cob_datapipeline -E`) is run by Travis on every PR.

How to run pytests (unit tests, largely) on this repository (run by Travis on every PR):

```
$ pipenv run pytest
```

## Deployment

CircleCI is used for CI and CD.

### CI

We run pylint and pytest to check the basics. These are run within a Pipenv shell to manage expected packages across all possibly environments.

### CD

We deploy via the tulibraries/ansible-playbook-airflow ansible playbook. This runs, pointing at the appropriate tulibraries/funcake_dags branch (qa or master) to clone & set up (run pip install based on the Pipenv files) within the relevant Airflow deployed environment.

PRs merged to QA cause a QA environment deploy of tulibraries/ansible-playbook-airflow ansible playbook; PRs merged to Master cause a Stage Environment deploy using that airflow playbook. PRs merged to Master also queue up a Production Environment deploy, that waits for user input before running.

The idea is to eventually touch the airflow ansible playbook as little as possible, and have DAG changes occur here & deploy from here.
